# Youtube Downloader

### Python , youtube-dl

## Description

I've written a script in python that will allow you to download videos from YouTube: <br>
     whether it's a single video,  <br>
     or an entire playlist. <br>

All you need to do is : <br>
    1. open YouTube web site , <br>
    2. copy the link of the page,  <br>
    3. click on the script, <br>
    4. and wait for the download to complete. <br> <br>

note: The file is downloaded where the script is located <br> <br>


* Operating requirements: Installing the following packages using the pip:
```python
pip install youtube-dl
pip install pyperclip
pip install pprint
```
* Install powershell, and place his path in the script
